# Todarch Contracts

Contracts are organized in a single place. Under the coordinates of each project, there are contracts of the consumers.

## Consumer

- Find your provider coordinates under `src/main/resources/contracts/`

- If not found, create and add the a pom.xml containing parts of the provider's pom.xml

```shell
cd to/provider/coordinate/directory
mvn clean install
```

## Provider

- create the JAR that contains all contracts in `src/main/resources/contracts/`

```shell
cd todarch-cdc
mvn clean install
```

- now you can go back and work on the provider side, provider will pull in the JAR with all contracts and generate verification tests.
